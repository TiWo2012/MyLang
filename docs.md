## basics

in here you will learn how to write your fist basic program in mylang. It is really simple.

### return statement

The `return` statement is used to return a value from a function. The syntax for the `return` statement is as follows:

`return <value>;`

### variables

The `let` statement is used to declare variables. There are no types in this simple language.
For examples have a look at `examples/variables.myl`

### print statement

to print out something to the console you can use the `print(<value>)` statement. it is not possible to print mor than one thing at once.

## Compiler

The Compiler has some basic arguments.

- `-o <outputFileName>`: Tels the program to use a different output file name instead of the default `out`.

- `-p`: Prints out the file content of the file which gets compiled.

- `-v`: outputs the Version of the compiler.
