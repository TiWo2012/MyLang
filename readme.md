MyLang is a custom programming language designed for simplicity and ease of use.
It features a unique syntax and is intended for educational purposes.

I would be glad for any Feedback.

## Installation

To install MyLang, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Repository**: Clone the MyLang repository to a folder of your choice, where you would like to install the MyLang interpreter.
2. **Compile the Code**: Navigate to the cloned repository and run the `make` command to compile the code. This process may take some time, depending on your machine's speed.
3. **Create an Alias (Optional)**: To make it easier to use MyLang, we recommend creating an alias in your terminal. This will allow you to run MyLang from anywhere in your system.

## Using MyLang

Once installed, you can use MyLang to write and execute your own programs. Here's a brief overview of how to get started:

* **Write Your Program**: Create a new file with a `.myl` extension and start writing your program using the MyLang syntax.
* **Run Your Program**: Use the MyLang interpreter to run your program. If you created an alias, you can simply type `mylang your_program.myl` to execute it.
* **Explore the Language**: MyLang features a unique syntax and is designed for simplicity and ease of use. Take some time to explore the language and its features to get the most out of it.

## testing

files for testing purposes cann be found under the `./examples/` folder found. You cann modify any of the files in the folder as long as you dont commit to the repository I am down. If you got a realy good program submit a pull request so I cann have a look at it.

## Warning

* **Warning**: MyLang is still in its early stages of development. it is not functional yet.
* **Warning**: At the end of a file always needs to be a empty line because the program wont read the last line.
* **Warning**: Only works on MacOs and Linux because it gets compiled/interperted into Bash.(`.sh`)
